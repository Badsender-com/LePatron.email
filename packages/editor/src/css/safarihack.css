/*
Safari Hack: Safari create reflow glitches due to a webkit bug with border-spacing (cellspacing)
when the template being edited makes use of horizontal border spacing.
  See: https://github.com/voidlabs/mosaico/issues/53
The following are terrible hacks to make this happens less often.
It seems something similar happens to Chrome, too;
  See:; https://github.com/voidlabs/mosaico/issues/85
So we broadened the application of this hack to include Chrome.

/*
After enabling the dashed outlines for editable contents we had reports from webkit based
browsers (Safari) users of flickering similar to the previous issues.
  See: https://github.com/voidlabs/mosaico/issues/430
Then we separated semi-transparent hover effect from the selection effect into before/after so
that we never have to change the opacity or the border size dynamically and this seems to make Safari
happier.
