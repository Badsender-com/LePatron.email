Copy and paste those url in the `Buildpacks` section of `Settings`

This has to be done BEFORE any deploy

They provide an easy way to install all necessary service but can be omitted if an identical service is provided outside Heroku.

Go to `Tags and alerts` and un-check the corresponding line.

## configuring heroku environments variables

- go in the settings of your application
- click on `settings`
- click on `Reveal Config Vars`
- variables name should follow this pattern:

```
lepatron_emailOptions__from
```

- always put `lepatron_` first
- then each level of config should be seperate with a double underscore: `__`
- see `.lepatronrc-example` on the master branch for the config requirements

below are the common environments variables you should want to set:

### mail sending

lepatron_emailTransport__service         Mailjet
lepatron_emailTransport__auth__user      your Username (or API key)

#### getting an AWS id

[console.aws.amazon.com/iam](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) -> **create new access key**

#### creating the bucket

[console.aws.amazon.com/s3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3) -> **create bucket**

you have also to set the good policy for the bucket:

**Properties** -> **Permissions** -> **Add bucket policy**

and copy and paste this:

```json
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOURBUCKETNAME/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

then replace `YOURBUCKETNAME` by your real bucket name

### Other config

```js
// redirect any http request to https
forcessl:       false,
images: {
  // needed only if not using S3 image storage
  uploadDir:    'uploads',
  // tmp directory name for image upload
  tmpDir:       'tmp',
  // cache resized images & add cache-control to image request
  cache:        false,
},
```
